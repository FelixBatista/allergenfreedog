# Dog Allergy Symptoms: Complete Guide to Recognition and Management

Recognizing allergy symptoms in dogs is the first step toward effective treatment and relief. This comprehensive guide covers all types of allergic reactions, their causes, and what pet owners should watch for.

## Types of Dog Allergies

### 1. Environmental Allergies (Atopy)
**Most Common Type**

Environmental allergies occur when dogs react to substances in their environment such as pollen, dust mites, mold, or grass.

**Common Triggers:**
- Tree pollen (oak, birch, cedar)
- Grass pollen (rye, bermuda, timothy)
- Weed pollen (ragweed, sagebrush)
- Dust mites
- Mold spores
- Household chemicals

### 2. Food Allergies
**Often Misdiagnosed**

Food allergies develop when dogs' immune systems react to specific proteins in their diet.

**Common Food Allergens:**
- Beef (most common)
- Dairy products
- Chicken
- Eggs
- Wheat
- Soy
- Corn
- Fish

### 3. Contact Allergies
**Less Common but Important**

Contact allergies occur when dogs react to substances that touch their skin.

**Common Contact Allergens:**
- Certain shampoos or grooming products
- Flea collars
- Plastic food bowls
- Carpet fibers
- Laundry detergents
- Certain fabrics

### 4. Flea Allergy Dermatitis
**Most Preventable**

Flea allergy dermatitis is an allergic reaction to flea saliva, not the flea itself.
