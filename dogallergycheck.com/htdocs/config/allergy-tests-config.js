  // FAQ questions and answers
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between an allergy and an intolerance?",
      answer: "An allergen means that your pup has an immune reaction to the substance; this can lead to symptoms such as itching, hives, and even anaphylaxis. Intolerance means that the pup is not having an allergic reaction but is instead experiencing uncomfortable symptoms such as intestinal upset or skin irritation when consuming the food item in question."
    },
    {
      question: "How do vets test for allergies?", 
      answer: "Veterinarians can perform RAST (radioallergosorbent) blood tests, intradermal skin testing, or serum allergy tests. These tests measure IgE, IgG, and immune complexes to identify specific allergens causing reactions in your dog."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a veterinarian allergy test for dogs cost?",
      answer: "Veterinary allergy testing typically costs $200-500 or more, depending on the type of test and your location. At-home tests offer a more affordable alternative at $80-160, though they should be used as a starting point and discussed with your vet."
    },
    {
      question: "Does pet insurance cover allergy testing?",
      answer: "You'll need to check with your pet insurance provider. Most pet health insurance will cover allergy testing together with the office visit for skin conditions and other related health conditions, but coverage varies by plan."
    },
    {
      question: "Are at-home allergy tests accurate?",
      answer: "At-home allergy tests can provide valuable insights into potential food sensitivities and intolerances. While they may not be as comprehensive as veterinary testing, they offer a good starting point for identifying problematic foods and can help guide dietary changes."
