Effective allergy treatment requires a comprehensive approach combining medical interventions, environmental control, and lifestyle modifications. This guide covers all available treatment options for managing dog allergies.

### 2. Corticosteroids
**Powerful Anti-Inflammatory**

Corticosteroids are highly effective for reducing inflammation and itching but should be used judiciously.

**Types:**
